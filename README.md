# AppCapstone

An Android App for buying and trading fake equity (equivalent to inventory in this case). Run on Android Studio with an SQLite backend, this is my first crack at app development. To run, load the project onto Android Studio and use the android phone simulator.

The app was built using the Java standard library and the SQLite packages. Going into this project I knew that the requirements were simply to have a user-friendly format to display the different equity, and a data structure that could store information for all users and all companies. With these in mind, I decided on an Android app and a SQLite database to fit my needs. Apart from Java, the only other languages utilized were a few lines of SQL as well as some XML to define the appâ€™s different pages.
